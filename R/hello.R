#### attempting to generalize an algorithm used in my final project

# this function will take in the inputs of census data (at whatever level) and
# (preferably) city boundaries. Then it will crop the data to the boundaries.


# step 1: setting the CRS -------------------------------------
city_census_data <- funtion(census, bounds) {  ## census == census data, bounds == boundaries (shp., etc)



}
