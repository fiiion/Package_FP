This is my first package in R. I'm using the functions within the scripts for my final project, which I'm trying to make as reproducible as possible. Ideally, I would be able to scale the project up to do any city, but there are some challenges, particularly that I have not found a database with all the US city boundaries, as of yet. Relatedly, there are some variables in my mapping process that are city-dependent, making it more difficult to automate.
